This project's offline cryptos refer to tangible assets that are valued in gold baskets and therefore retain their value even in the event of a blackout and hyperinflation, yet can be traded like cryptocurrencies via existing blockchains.

In the event of a blackout, the offline cryptos go offline.

This project's offline cryptos have a redemption obligation in gold baskets. Since their value fluctuates proportionally with the gold price, they are also immune to any hyperinflation.

Delivery of gold via the home country's CEX is also planned, but this incurs storage fees and postage for valuables transport.

With offline cryptos, however, one can exchange the owner for a compensation payment. The owner must assign a new PIN before purchasing and must also have a balance, which ensures the immediate purchase of the same amount of gold at the storage location.

Once the gold is purchased and all conditions are met, the smart contract is executed immediately. The old owner can no longer initiate delivery using their PIN, and the new owner can initiate delivery as soon as enough CEX have stored the current purchase in the blockchain and signed it, regardless of the encrypted method (microwave, satellite, internet) they used to learn about it. A CEX acts like the signer of a fingerprint.

In offline mode, offline cryptos can change hands via a black box using a PIN. The transfer of value is secured by a protocol that prohibits mining and minting.

In principle, offline cryptos could be printed in a newspaper and an ounce offered as a prize to anyone who manages to acquire this ounce using this crypto. Even theft or confiscation does not cause any damage, because the stored ounce is insured and would be immediately exchanged for another.

There is only one difficulty. You need the PIN that matches the ounce, the PIN that matches the storage number, and the PIN that matches the random seed hash, but you only have three attempts to guess it.

If even one of these fails, or a component is missing, only the rightful owner can refresh the crypto via their black box, and they can do so without any risk as long as they are within reach of a CEX or DEX with the black box that can reach at least one other CEX via microwave or satellite that registered the purchase or sale.

A satellite blackout is extremely rare, and even then, it's still possible to refresh the crypto via microwave at selected locations using the black box.
