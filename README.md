# offlinecrypto
This project's offline cryptos refer to tangible assets that are valued in the basket of gold and therefore retain their value even in the event of a blackout or hyperinflation, yet can be traded like cryptocurrencies via existing blockchains. In the event of a blockout, they go offline.
